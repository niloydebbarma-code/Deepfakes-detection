# Deepfakes Detection

Welcome to the Deepfakes Detection project! This repository is all about creating tools to spot manipulated media, which is crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness of digital content.

## What This Project Is About

This project focuses on using machine learning to detect deepfakes—videos and images that have been altered or created to mislead. Here’s what you’ll find inside:

- *Google Colab Notebook*: This Jupyter notebook will guide you through the entire process of training and evaluating models to detect deepfakes. It's set up to run on TPU v2-8 for better performance.
- *DeepfakeTIMIT Dataset*: This dataset is essential for training and testing the models that help us identify deepfakes.

## What’s Included

Here’s a quick look at the files and directories you’ll find in this repository:

- `DeepfakeTIMIT/`: This folder holds the dataset you need for training and evaluating your models.
- `Google Colab Deepfakes-detection.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook where you'll perform all the training and testing.
- `README.md`: This file, providing you with all the information you need to get started.

## How to Get Started

Here’s a simple guide to get you up and running:

1. *Clone the Repository*
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niloydebbarma-code/Deepfakes-detection.git
   cd Deepfakes-detection

2. *Run the Notebook*
Open the Google Colab Deepfakes-detection.ipynb notebook in Google Colab. It’s configured to use TPU v2-8 for fast processing. Just follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate your models.


3. *Get the Dataset*
Download the DeepfakeTIMIT dataset and place it in the DeepfakeTIMIT/ directory. The notebook will guide you on how to use the dataset.



## How to Use It

The notebook covers everything from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction. Feel free to tweak the parameters and paths to fit your needs.
