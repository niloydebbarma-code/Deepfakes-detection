# Deepfakes Detection

Welcome to the Deepfakes Detection project! This repository is all about creating tools to identify manipulated media, which is essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of digital content.

## What’s Inside

This project uses machine learning to detect deepfake videos and images. Here’s a quick look at what you’ll find:

- **Google Colab Notebook**: The heart of the project, this Jupyter notebook guides you through the process of training, evaluating, and predicting deepfake content.
- **DeepfakeTIMIT Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing our models.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Begin by cloning the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niloydebbarma-code/Deepfakes-detection.git
   cd Deepfakes-detection

2. Run the Notebook Open Google Colab Deepfakes-detection.ipynb in Google Colab. The notebook is set up to run on TPU v2-8 for faster processing. Follow the instructions within the notebook to start training and evaluating your models.


3. Download the Dataset Download the DeepfakeTIMIT dataset and place it in the DeepfakeTIMIT/ directory. The notebook will help you with the necessary steps to use the dataset effectively.



Using the Project

The notebook provides comprehensive steps from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Customize the parameters and paths as needed for your specific use case.
