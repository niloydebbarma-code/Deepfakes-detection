# Deepfakes Detection

Welcome to the Deepfakes Detection project! This repository is dedicated to developing tools for detecting manipulated media, a crucial step in ensuring the integrity of digital content.

## What’s Inside

This project uses machine learning to identify deepfake videos and images. Here's a quick overview of what you'll find:

- **Google Colab Notebook**: This is where all the magic happens. It's a Jupyter notebook that guides you through training, evaluating, and predicting deepfake content.
- **DeepfakeTIMIT Dataset**: This dataset is used for training our models and evaluating their performance.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Start by cloning this repo to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niloydebbarma-code/Deepfakes-detection.git
   cd Deepfakes-detection

2. Set Up Your Environment Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. You can install any necessary libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Notebook Open Google Colab Deepfakes-detection.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to start training and evaluating your models.


4. Get the Dataset Download the DeepfakeTIMIT dataset and place it in the DeepfakeTIMIT/ directory. The notebook will guide you on how to use the data.



Using the Project

The notebook covers everything from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Feel free to tweak the settings and paths to suit your needs.
